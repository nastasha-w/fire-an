code and scripts for finding main halos, making histograms and 2D
projected maps, and analysing those products in FIRE simulations

This repo is mainly for me to sync up in-progress work. Much of this
code is untested, half-finished projects I abandoned, or work in 
progress. Also, I have a tendency to do work and testing on the main
branch.

Note that tests are usually of the 'plot and see if it makes sense'
form, not functions that will return a boolean value.
